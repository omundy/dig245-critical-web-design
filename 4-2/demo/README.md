# Lite Swiss Design

In this demo, you will be recreating the Swiss Design poster below, using only HTML/CSS and text (no images). You have been provided with an `index.html` file that contains the content of the poster. Use this as your starting point. With a partner, add CSS to `assets/css/styles.css` to try to replicate the poster.

# Favicons


Favicons (short for "favorite icons") are the small images used to identify web pages in browser tabs and bookmarks. Above, you can see the favicons for Sneakaway Studio and Figma in the page's tab and bookmarks bar.



## How to make a favicon

Favicons are relatively easy to make an add to your website.

1. Create an image or icon at least 128 pixels square. Keep in mind it will be resized to 16x16 and 32x32 depending on the location it is viewed.
1. Save it as a .png file.
1. Use a [free online converter](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) to export the right formats.
1. Add the files and code to your website


## Issues?

1. Make sure to include all the files with the correct paths
1. Add a direct `link` to the `.ico` file if using it from within a directory
1. See this example: [examples/favicon_io/index.html](./examples/favicon_io/index.html)



## Other favicon tools

- Choose your own text and colors to [generate](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) your favicon
- Select an [emoji](https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/) to make your favicon

... and download and install the file(s) per their instructions.

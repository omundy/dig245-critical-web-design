	<h1>WEB 1</h1>
	
	<div class="header_text">
	
		Currently majoring in both studio art and adverting, I’m excited to be learning web design because I think that today, if you dont posses even the basic knowledge of the workings of the web, your bound to fall far behind fairly quickly.

		<p>Also, when working as a designer, most people expect you to have some understanding of web design, if not your very own website. This is why I’m here, to learn how to create a place on the internet were I can display my work and offer myself as a designer. </p>

		<h2>Manifesto</h2>
		
		
		
		
		<p>I enrolled in college as a Political Science major. I attended their orientation and walked out on the first group orientation, immediately changing my major to Graphic Design, where I belonged.</p>
		
		<p>I learned a few things that day. 1) Social scientists are even crazier than artists. 2) No matter what, I could never sell out and be a bureaucrat, nor could I waste any artistic talent that I had in a 9-5 office job. But most importantly I learned that I love anything to do with design and working in the arts is truly the place I belong.</p>
		
		<p>I love design because I truly believe that it is the future of art. Although not the most eloquent writer or public speaker, I love to communicate with people and the graphic design medium allows me the freedom to do just that with artistic skill and creativity.</p>
		
		<p>“If you're gonna be a graphic designer because you can’t make it as a fine artist, you’re better off becoming an accountant.” </p>

# Hello World! demo

In this first demo we'll get a taste of HTML by building the [A1: Hello World! assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17U_zmzM_eML_qkG0PaOdDRcEk3YEmbiQ1TyNnbAM08k/edit?usp=sharing) in class. Refer to the [W3Schools HTML documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) as needed.
